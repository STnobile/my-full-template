        <h2>Background</h2>
          
        <p> <span>Wine-Hub</span>
            was born from the idea of three guys,
      <span>Kevin</span> ,  <span> Stefano </span> and <span>Federico</span>,
      that thanks to international experiences
      acquired in the wine trading sector
      and digital marketing,
      they gave birth to an idea
      that is about to become reality.</p>
         
      <p>The project is designed for all lovers of the beverage sector,
      offering the platform as a tool for:
      </p>
          <p>
            Individuals who intend to invest in high-quality wines or simplybuy and sell fine labels from their cellar.
           Professional of the hospitality world who intend to sell 
           the best labels left unsold due to a limited number of high   spending customers, 
           creating important blocks to cash flows
      
           The platform's task will also be to facilitate and speed up this type of operations, in a safe, simple and borderless way.
      
            In terms of expansion, the goal is to grow in Europe following a very simple and targeted strategy by choosing the major European capitals as territory, 
            with an initial focus on London and Milan.
          </p>

        <h2>Discovery</h2>

        <p> 
          <span> <span>Wine Hub</span> is the first European platform entirely dedicated to the sale of fine wines and spirits for individuals and traders.</span></p>
        
            
        <p>The market of fine wines and spirits is complex and articulated, often the sales relations take place between private individuals, directly, without guarantees or controls.
      
         It often happens that companies are often unable to sell their best labels due to a limited number of high spending customers, and this severely penalizes business opportunities.
      
         On the other hand, many aficionados own fine wines but do not have a reliable tool to buy or sell this particular type of product.
      
         Finally, the Wine Investors, who buy and sell a large number of bottles very frequently, currently do not have a dedicated channel that allows them to increase the flow and quality of transactions.
      
         Wine Hub allows enthusiasts, investors and companies to meet in one place and finalize sales in total safety and speed.
        </p>
