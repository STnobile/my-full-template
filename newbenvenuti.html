                <span>Wine-Hub</span>
            was born from the idea of three guys,
      <span>Kevin</span> ,  <span> Stefano </span> and <span id="sp">Federico</span>,
      that thanks to international experiences
      acquired in the wine trading sector
      and digital marketing,
      they gave birth to an idea
      that is about to become reality.</p>
         
      <p>The project is designed for all lovers of the beverage sector,
      offering the platform as a tool for:
      <br>
            Individuals who intend to invest in high-quality wines or simplybuy and sell fine labels from their cellar.
           Professional of the hospitality world who intend to sell 
           the best labels left unsold due to a limited number of high   spending customers, 
           creating important blocks to cash flows
      
           The platform's task will also be to facilitate and speed up this type of operations, in a safe, simple and borderless way.
      
            In terms of expansion, the goal is to grow in Europe following a very simple and targeted strategy by choosing the major European capitals as territory, 
            with an initial focus on London and Milan.
